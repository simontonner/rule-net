# Deep Binary Classifier using Rule-Based Nodes


This project is part of the course Practical Work in AI (Master) at Johannes Kepler University Linz. It explores the use of rule-based nodes in a deep network for binary prediction tasks.

The architecture is based on the work ["Learning and Memorization" by Satrajit Chatterjee (2018)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/chatterjee18a.html), which introduces deep classifiers built entirely from Lookup Tables (LUTs). [Gstrein (2022)](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/gstrein/) reimplemented this concept in his Master's Thesis "Tuning the Learning of Circuit-Based Classifiers", expanding on training strategies.

This project builds on both implementations and investigates whether individual LUT nodes can be effectively replaced by rule-based classifiers. It uses RIPPER for logic rule extraction.
